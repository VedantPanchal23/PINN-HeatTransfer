# ðŸ”¥ Modeling and Optimization of Heat Transfer in Complex Geometries Using PINNs

This project implements **Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)** to solve and optimize the **transient heat conduction problem** in complex 2D geometries. The model incorporates various boundary conditions (Dirichlet, Neumann, and Robin) and aims to minimize maximum temperature through geometry or material optimization.


## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

- âœ… Solve transient heat transfer PDE using PINNs
- âœ… Apply Dirichlet, Neumann, and Robin boundary conditions
- âœ… Optimize geometry/material properties to minimize peak temperature
- ðŸ”„ Compare PINN results with Finite Element Method (FEM) solutions


## ðŸ§  Techniques Used

- **PINNs (Physics-Informed Neural Networks)** using PyTorch
- **Autograd** for computing PDE residuals
- **Optimization** using gradient-based and black-box techniques
- **Visualization** using Matplotlib and animations


## You can find all my implementation in notebook

## Contributions are welcome! Please fork the repository and submit a pull request.

## ðŸ§ª Future Work

- Add complex geometries and mesh handling

- **Incorporate Robin boundary conditions

- FEM integration for validation

- Extend to 3D problems
